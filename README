hearnet - listen to your network

Requirements:
- libpcap
- libjack

Synopsis:
    make
    sudo make suid
    # start jack if necessary
    ./hearnet

Details:

hearnet now drops priveleges when run with the suid bit set, which means
you can hook it into your regular non-root jackd, and run it as a normal
user. 

You can specify a filter expression (a la tcpdump), e.g.:

    ./hearnet eth0 udp port 53

Very nice for listening to just one kind of traffic. Try this for an
accompaniment to your VOIP conversation:

    ./hearnet eth0 udp port sip
