	* changed code so that it uses 32-voice polyphony and plays bridges / 
	  chromatic orders.
	  
	  as an effect, you get very harmonic sounds if packet sizes on a 
	  site are the same, and quite weird stuff if packet sizes vary.

    * Incorporated patch from Von Fugal allowing multiple instances of hearnet
