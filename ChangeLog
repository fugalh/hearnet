    * make hearnet suid and drop privileges right after libpcap
      initialization.
    * Mutex in jack_process is a very bad thing. Moreover, it seems
      there's no need for it, as voice->active field serves as a mutex.
      
      N.B. It's good enough I think, but I wonder if we might need some
      sort of memory barrier, as noted in the comments. -- Hans

    * Added filter expression support, so now you can say
      ./hearnet eth0 "udp port 53"
      or whatever kind of filter expression you can think of.  Very nice for
      listening in on just specific traffic patterns!

    * changed code so that it uses 32-voice polyphony and plays bridges / 
      chromatic orders.
      
      as an effect, you get very harmonic sounds if packet sizes on a 
      site are the same, and quite weird stuff if packet sizes vary.

    * Incorporated patch from Von Fugal allowing multiple instances of hearnet
      to register with jackd, so you can hear more than one network at a time.

    * Cleaned up and consolidated code
    * Can specify interface to listen to on command line now.
    * usage()
